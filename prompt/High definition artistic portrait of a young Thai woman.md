`High definition artistic portrait of a young Thai woman sitting in the middle of a rice field during sunset. Her body is covered in mud and water realistically, conveying a deep emotion. She has long straight black hair, smooth skin, light makeup, wearing a purple tank top and gray shorts stained with mud. Sitting in a contemplative pose, she turns her back slightly and looks back at the camera with deep sad eyes and a faint smile. Portrait shot with blurred background, the background is a green rice field and a beautiful cloudy sky. The light, shadows and reflections of the water in the rice field are natural, giving a beautiful and profound feeling like a movie.`
